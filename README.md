This project is a simple Login screen. <br>
It has two text fields, one for the email and another for the password. The password field has a visibility icon that allows the user to see or hide the password. The screen also has two buttons, one for login and another for registration. 
The login button has a function that checks if the email and password are correct. 
If they are, the user is redirected to the home screen. If not, a snackbar is shown with an error message. 

The home screen is the screen that the user sees after logging in. 
It has a welcome message and a button to logout the application.
